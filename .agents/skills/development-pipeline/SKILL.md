# Development Pipeline (Complex Features)

When executing a complex feature, follow these steps strictly:

1. **Analyze**: Read `.agents/AgentMap.yaml` to understand the current architecture and identify dependency impacts. DO NOT read `HumanMap.md` yet.
2. **Plan**: Formulate an implementation plan report detailing the scope and impact.
3. **Review (Mandatory)**: Write the proposed plan to a temporary `task.md` or `pr_review.md` artifact. Invoke the `plan-critic` sub-agent to audit the raw artifact. Refine the plan based on feedback.
4. **User Approval**: Present the plan to the user and wait for explicit approval.
5. **Test (TDD Setup)**: Invoke the `qa-engineer` to write unit tests for the planned feature/fix. Ensure these tests run and fail appropriately.
6. **Implement**: Invoke the `full-stack-engineer` to execute the code changes required to make the tests pass. Run tests iteratively until all pass.
7. **Security Check**: Invoke the `security-engineer` to audit the final code before committing.
8. **Document**: Update `.agents/HumanMap.md` and `.agents/AgentMap.yaml` to reflect the changes. (Trigger the `update-humanmap` skill for formatting rules).
9. **Commit**: Use `git diff`, `git add <source_files>`, and `git commit -m "feat: description"` to save the changes. NEVER push.
